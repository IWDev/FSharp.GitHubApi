#FSharp.GitHubApi#

An F# implementation of a [GitHub Api](http://developer.github.com/) wrapper.

##Notes##

Originally intended to just be part of [OctocatTools](http://github.com/saxonmatt/OctocatTools/) - I've decided to move it out to be a separate repository and just use it as a submodule... and perhaps one day as a NuGet package or whatever.
